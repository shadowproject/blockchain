Shadow Blockchain

What is blockchain.zip?

It is the verified and indexed database containing Shadow blockchain data, from the genesis block through a recent height.
This is created from the bootstrap.dat from this project : https://github.com/shadowproject/bootstrap

------------------------
Who wants blockchain.zip?

Anyone bringing up a new node using the reference client.  This is the fastest method of getting the blockchain data and a fully synchronised client within ten minutes.

-----------------------
Why should I trust you?

The download includes a DIGESTS.txt file which includes the sha256sum for the bootstrap file used to create this data file. You can verify this by comparing these values against those from https://github.com/shadowproject/bootstrap OR you may generate your own bootstrap.dat, up to a same height, and verify that the sha256sum matches.
